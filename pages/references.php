          <blockquote>"I have complete confidence that you will enjoy the modeling skills of Aaron McCloud. He holds interesting poses without prompting and is aware of working 'in the round'. He brings the benefits of his martial arts practice to bear in his physicality. He is well-proportioned and graceful. I also appreciate his promptness, communication skills and all-around professionalism. I highly recommend him."</blockquote>

He is prompt and ready on time, has a great sense of energy and can hold a pose throughout the evening. We enjoy having him pose for us and will continue to work with him!"</blockquote>
